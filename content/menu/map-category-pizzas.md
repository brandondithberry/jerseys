  ### **Morgantown's Exclusive Authentic New York Style Pizza**


  Pizza making is truly an art. It requires the proper balance of a rich mozzarella cheese, flavorful sauce, and all on a thin crust. Sauces cannot just be dumped out of a can, and cheese cannot be pre-shredded from a vacuum sealed bag. Equally important is the crust that must baked on a stone and not on a screen run through conveyor oven. Just like our cheesesteaks are off the charts so is our pizza. We make our pizzas the way they should be made like the pies in New York where true pizza originates. If you want a real pie and not what the big chains offer you need to try ours. And if you’re trying to feed a lot of people for a school, party, or office we offer big order discounts and can deliver.
